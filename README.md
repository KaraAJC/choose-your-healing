When I click "Add to Cart",
- I am taken to a screen that shows me my selection, and a receipt for $0.00.
- I can click "Confirm" or "Cancel".
When I click "Confirm",
- I am redirected to a page that says "Thank You For Your Order".
If at any time I click "Cancel",
- I am redirected to the home page.
